### Deploying AingDesk
1. Log in to the BT Panel and click on Docker in the menu bar. Follow the prompts to install Docker and Docker Compose services.
2. Find `AingDesk` in the `Docker - App Store`, and click `Install`.
3. Set basic information such as the domain name and click `Confirm`.
   - Name: Application name, default is `AingDesk-random characters`.
   - Version selection: Default is `latest`.
   - Domain: If you want to access via a domain, configure the domain here and point the domain to your server.
   - Allow external access: If you need direct access via `IP + Port`, check this option. If you have already set up a domain, do not select this.
   - Port: Default is `7071`, but you can modify it if needed.
4. After submission, the panel will automatically initialize the application. This process usually takes about `1-3 minutes`. Once initialization is complete, you can access AingDesk.

### Accessing AingDesk
```bash
# Using a domain
http://yourdomain/
# Using IP + port
http://your_server_ip:7071/
